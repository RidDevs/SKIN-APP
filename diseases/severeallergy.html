    <div class="container">
        <h2>What are Severe Allergic Reactions?</h2>
        <p>A severe allergic reaction, also known as anaphylaxis, is a life-threatening emergency caused by an exaggerated immune response to a substance the body mistakenly identifies as harmful. These reactions can occur within seconds or minutes of exposure to an allergen and can affect multiple parts of the body. Immediate medical intervention is crucial to prevent serious complications or death.</p>
        <p>Common triggers for severe allergic reactions include certain foods, insect stings, medications, and latex. People with known allergies are at higher risk, and the symptoms of anaphylaxis require rapid treatment with an epinephrine injection (adrenaline).</p>

        <h2>Signs and Symptoms of Severe Allergic Reactions</h2>
        <p>The symptoms of anaphylaxis can develop quickly and may vary from person to person. Common signs and symptoms include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Swelling of the face, throat, or lips</span> – This can lead to difficulty breathing or swallowing, and may occur within minutes of exposure to the allergen.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Skin reactions</span> – Itching, hives, redness, or a rash can occur, often accompanied by swelling.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Breathing difficulties</span> – Shortness of breath, wheezing, or tightness in the chest may occur as the airway narrows due to swelling.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Rapid or weak pulse</span> – A quickened heart rate or a weak pulse may indicate a severe reaction.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Dizziness or fainting</span> – This can be a sign of a drop in blood pressure, leading to shock.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Gastrointestinal symptoms</span> – Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea are common symptoms of an allergic reaction affecting the stomach.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Loss of consciousness</span> – In extreme cases, a person may faint or lose consciousness if the allergic reaction worsens rapidly.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Triggers of Severe Allergic Reactions</h2>
        <p>Severe allergic reactions can be triggered by a wide variety of allergens, which are substances that cause the immune system to overreact. Common triggers include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Food allergens</span> – Common foods that can cause anaphylaxis include peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish, eggs, milk, soy, and wheat.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Insect stings</span> – Bee, wasp, and hornet stings can trigger a severe allergic reaction, especially in individuals who have been stung before.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Medications</span> – Certain medications, including antibiotics (e.g., penicillin) and pain relievers (e.g., aspirin, ibuprofen), can cause anaphylaxis in some people.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Latex</span> – People who have a latex allergy may experience anaphylaxis after coming into contact with latex gloves, balloons, or other latex-containing items.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Inhaled allergens</span> – For some individuals, airborne allergens like pollen, dust mites, and pet dander can trigger severe reactions.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Exercise-induced anaphylaxis</span> – In rare cases, physical exercise can trigger an allergic reaction, especially when combined with certain foods.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How is Anaphylaxis Treated?</h2>
        <p>Anaphylaxis requires immediate treatment, as the symptoms can escalate quickly and lead to death if left untreated. The primary treatment for severe allergic reactions is the administration of epinephrine (adrenaline) via an injection. This helps reverse the symptoms by relaxing the muscles in the airways and constricting blood vessels to raise blood pressure.</p>
        <p>Key steps in treating anaphylaxis include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Administer epinephrine</span> – If you or someone you are with has an epinephrine auto-injector (e.g., EpiPen), it should be administered immediately. This is typically injected into the outer thigh and can be done through clothing if necessary.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Seek emergency medical help</span> – Even if symptoms improve after epinephrine, it is important to seek immediate medical attention. A second dose of epinephrine may be required, and other treatments such as antihistamines or steroids may be given.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Position the person correctly</span> – If the person is conscious and able to breathe, have them sit up or lie down with their legs elevated. If the person loses consciousness or has difficulty breathing, place them on their side in the recovery position.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to Prevent Severe Allergic Reactions</h2>
        <p>Prevention of severe allergic reactions involves avoiding known allergens and being prepared in case of exposure. Here are several key preventive measures:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Carry an epinephrine auto-injector</span> – If you have a known allergy, always carry an epinephrine auto-injector and ensure you and your loved ones know how to use it.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Avoid known allergens</span> – Stay away from foods, medications, or other substances that have caused allergic reactions in the past.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Wear a medical alert bracelet</span> – This can help medical personnel identify your allergies in case of an emergency.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Educate friends, family, and coworkers</span> – Make sure those around you are aware of your allergies and know what to do in case of an emergency.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Have an allergy action plan</span> – Work with your doctor to create an emergency plan that outlines what to do if you have an allergic reaction.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>When to Seek Medical Attention</h2>
        <p>Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any signs or symptoms of a severe allergic reaction, especially if they are rapidly progressing. If the symptoms do not improve after administering epinephrine, it is critical to go to the hospital for additional care.</p>
        <p>In some cases, a second dose of epinephrine may be necessary, as the effects of the first dose can wear off before the reaction is fully under control.</p>
