    </header>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>What is Shingles?</h2>
        <p>Shingles (also known as herpes zoster) is a viral infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox. After a person recovers from chickenpox, the virus remains dormant in the body and can reactivate years later as shingles. This reactivation typically occurs in older adults or individuals with weakened immune systems.</p>
        <p>Shingles can cause a painful rash that often appears on one side of the body or face, along with symptoms like fever, headache, and fatigue. The rash eventually forms fluid-filled blisters that scab over, typically healing within 2 to 4 weeks. However, some individuals experience lingering pain known as postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a complication that can persist for months or even years after the rash heals.</p>

        <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
        <p>The symptoms of shingles can vary in severity, but the most common signs include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Pain, burning, or tingling</span> – Often the first symptom of shingles, which may begin a few days before the rash appears. It typically starts in a specific area on one side of the body or face.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Red rash</span> – Appears a few days after the pain, often starting as small red spots that eventually develop into blisters.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Blisters</span> – Fluid-filled blisters develop on the rash, which may break open, leak fluid, and then crust over as the rash heals.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Itching</span> – The rash and blisters are often intensely itchy, leading to discomfort.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Fever and chills</span> – Many individuals with shingles experience mild fever, chills, and a general feeling of being unwell.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Headache and fatigue</span> – These symptoms are commonly reported during an outbreak of shingles.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Who is at Risk?</h2>
        <p>Shingles can occur at any age, but it is most common in people over 50. The risk of developing shingles increases with age, as the immune system naturally weakens over time. Individuals who have had chickenpox in the past are at risk, as the virus remains dormant in the body and can reactivate later. Other factors that increase the risk of shingles include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Being over 50 years old</li>
            <li>Having a weakened immune system due to conditions like HIV/AIDS, cancer, or immunosuppressive treatments (e.g., chemotherapy, steroids)</li>
            <li>Having had chickenpox in the past, as the virus remains dormant in nerve cells</li>
            <li>Having high stress levels or physical trauma that may trigger the reactivation of the virus</li>
            <li>Pregnancy or undergoing major surgery can temporarily weaken the immune system, increasing the risk of shingles.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How is Shingles Spread?</h2>
        <p>Shingles is not contagious in the same way as chickenpox. It is only spread through direct contact with the fluid-filled blisters of the rash. If a person who has never had chickenpox or received the chickenpox vaccine comes into contact with the shingles blisters, they could develop chickenpox, not shingles. It is important to avoid contact with people who are vulnerable, such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pregnant women who have never had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine</li>
            <li>Infants or young children who have not had chickenpox</li>
            <li>Individuals with compromised immune systems</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Complications of Shingles</h2>
        <p>Shingles can lead to a number of complications, some of which can be quite serious. Common complications include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN)</span> – This is the most common complication of shingles and refers to ongoing pain that persists even after the rash has healed. PHN can last for months or even years, and it is more common in people over 60.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Eye problems</span> – If shingles affects the eye, it can lead to vision loss, scarring, and other serious eye conditions. This is known as ocular shingles.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Bacterial infections</span> – The blisters can become infected with bacteria, which may lead to more severe skin issues or require antibiotics to treat.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Neurological problems</span> – In rare cases, shingles can lead to complications such as encephalitis (brain inflammation), meningitis (inflammation of the membranes covering the brain), or stroke.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Treatment for Shingles</h2>
        <p>There is no cure for shingles, but antiviral medications can help shorten the duration of the illness and reduce the severity of symptoms. The most common antiviral medications prescribed for shingles include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Acyclovir</span> – An antiviral drug that helps reduce the spread of the varicella-zoster virus and speeds up recovery.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Valacyclovir</span> – A medication similar to acyclovir but often preferred due to its ability to be taken less frequently.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Famciclovir</span> – Another antiviral medication used to treat shingles.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition to antiviral treatment, pain relief is an important part of shingles management. Options include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Over-the-counter pain relievers</span> – Acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help reduce pain and inflammation.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Topical treatments</span> – Creams or ointments containing capsaicin or lidocaine can help soothe the skin and relieve pain.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Corticosteroids</span> – In some cases, corticosteroids may be prescribed to reduce inflammation, though they are typically used sparingly due to potential side effects.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Prevention of Shingles</h2>
        <p>The best way to prevent shingles is through vaccination. The shingles vaccine, known as <span class="highlight">Shingrix</span>, is highly effective and is recommended for adults aged 50 and older, even those who have had shingles before. The vaccine can reduce the risk of developing shingles and help prevent the complications associated with the disease, including postherpetic neuralgia.</p>
        <p>Shingrix is given in two doses, with the second dose administered 2 to 6 months after the first. The vaccine has been shown to provide strong protection against shingles and its complications, and it is generally considered safe for most adults over the age of 50.</p>

        <h2>Self-Care and Tips for Recovery</h2>
        <p>While undergoing treatment for shingles, there are several self-care measures you can take to help reduce symptoms and speed recovery:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Get plenty of rest</span> – Resting allows your body to focus on fighting the virus and healing from the infection.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Cool compresses</span> – Applying a cool, damp cloth to the affected area can help reduce itching, swelling, and pain.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Wear loose clothing</span> – Tight or restrictive clothing can irritate the rash and increase discomfort.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Keep the rash clean and dry</span> – Avoid scratching or picking at the blisters to prevent infection.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Avoid contact with vulnerable individuals</span> – Stay away from pregnant women, infants, and those with weakened immune systems to prevent spreading the virus.</li>
        </ul>
