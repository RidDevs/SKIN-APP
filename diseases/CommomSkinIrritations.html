        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>Skin irritations are commonly caused by a variety of factors, such as allergic reactions, environmental influences, and infections. These irritations can cause discomfort, redness, swelling, and itchiness. While most skin irritations are not serious, they can impact the quality of life and may require appropriate care and treatment. Understanding the causes, symptoms, and proper treatment options can help you manage and prevent future flare-ups.</p>

        <h2>Types of Common Skin Irritations</h2>

        <p><strong>1. Contact Dermatitis</strong></p>
        <p>Contact dermatitis is an inflammation of the skin caused by direct contact with an irritant or allergen. The most common irritants include soaps, detergents, fragrances, and certain fabrics. Common allergens that can cause contact dermatitis include nickel, poison ivy, and latex.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Redness, itching, swelling, and blistering.</li>
            <li><strong>Treatment:</strong> Avoidance of irritants, using over-the-counter corticosteroids, and antihistamines.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>2. Eczema (Atopic Dermatitis)</strong></p>
        <p>Eczema is a chronic condition that leads to itchy, inflamed skin. It often occurs in patches on the hands, face, or behind the knees. Eczema can flare up when exposed to environmental triggers or allergens.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Dry, scaly, red, and inflamed patches of skin.</li>
            <li><strong>Treatment:</strong> Regular moisturizing, corticosteroid creams, and sometimes oral medications to control inflammation.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>3. Psoriasis</strong></p>
        <p>Psoriasis is an autoimmune condition that causes the skin cells to multiply too quickly, leading to thick, scaly patches. It can affect various parts of the body, including the scalp, elbows, knees, and lower back.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Red patches of skin covered with silvery scales, dry and cracked skin, itching, and burning.</li>
            <li><strong>Treatment:</strong> Topical treatments, phototherapy, and systemic treatments such as immunosuppressive drugs.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>4. Hives (Urticaria)</strong></p>
        <p>Hives are raised, red, itchy welts on the skin that can appear suddenly and may be caused by an allergic reaction, stress, or certain medications. They may appear anywhere on the body.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Raised, red welts, itching, and sometimes swelling of the lips, throat, or eyes.</li>
            <li><strong>Treatment:</strong> Antihistamines, avoiding allergens, and stress management.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>5. Sunburn</strong></p>
        <p>Sunburn is skin damage caused by overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays. It can result in red, painful, and sometimes blistered skin. Sunburn can increase the risk of developing skin cancer over time.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Red, inflamed, painful skin, blisters in severe cases.</li>
            <li><strong>Treatment:</strong> Aloe vera, cold compresses, pain relievers like ibuprofen, and avoiding further sun exposure.</li>
        </ul>
