        <h1>Xerosis (Dry Skin)</h1>

        <p>Xerosis, commonly known as dry skin, is a condition of rough, scaling, and sometimes cracking skin. Dry skin is caused by environmental factors, such as cold weather and frequent bathing, as well as by medical conditions such as atopic dermatitis (eczema), hypothyroidism, and malnutrition. Dry skin develops due to a decrease in the natural oils in the outer layer of skin, which makes the skin lose water.</p>

        <h2>Who's At Risk?</h2>
        <p>Dry skin can affect people of any age, race, ethnicity, and sex. However, the incidence of dry skin increases with age, and nearly all people older than 60 years have some degree of dry skin.</p>

        <p>Dry skin can be caused by environmental factors, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Low humidity</li>
            <li>Frequent bathing</li>
            <li>Harsh soaps</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Dry skin can also be caused by medical conditions such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ichthyosis</li>
            <li>Atopic dermatitis (eczema)</li>
            <li>Diabetes</li>
            <li>Hypothyroidism</li>
            <li>Down syndrome</li>
            <li>Liver or kidney disease</li>
            <li>Malnutrition</li>
            <li>HIV/AIDS</li>
            <li>Lymphoma</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Signs & Symptoms</h2>
        <p>The most common locations for dry skin are the:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Legs, especially the shins</li>
            <li>Arms</li>
            <li>Trunk</li>
            <li>Backs of the hands</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Dry skin appears as dull, rough skin with fine scales that flake off easily. In more advanced stages of dry skin, the skin may have cracks that resemble a dry lakebed. The skin flakes may be white or gray. Inflammation of the areas may lead to pink or red patches. Dry, inflamed skin tends to be mildly to severely itchy.</p>

        <h2>Self-Care Guidelines</h2>
        <p>Healthy bathing habits can improve dry skin, including:</p>
        <div class="self-care">
            <ul>
                <li>Taking a bath or shower only once daily. More frequent bathing can make the skin lose moisture.</li>
                <li>Using lukewarm (not hot) water.</li>
                <li>Limiting bathing to no more than 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Avoiding harsh deodorant soaps (or limit their use to armpits, groin, and feet).</li>
                <li>Using nonsoap cleansers (e.g., Dove Sensitive Skin Beauty Bar, Vanicream bar soap, and Nature by Canus).</li>
                <li>Patting (not rubbing) the skin dry after bathing.</li>
                <li>Applying moisturizer immediately after bathing, while the skin is still moist.</li>
                <li>Choosing a moisturizer that is an oil-based cream or ointment (e.g., CeraVe Moisturizing Cream, CeraVe Healing Ointment), as these work better than water-based lotions.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>The following over-the-counter products may be helpful:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Petrolatum or petroleum jelly (e.g., Vaseline)</li>
            <li>Fragrance-free creams or ointments (e.g., Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream)</li>
            <li>Preparations containing alpha-hydroxy acids such as glycolic acid or lactic acid (e.g., AmLactin Daily Moisturizing Lotion)</li>
            <li>Creams containing urea (e.g., Pedinol Ureacin-20 Moisturizing Cream)</li>
            <li>Over-the-counter cortisone cream (e.g., Cortisone-10) if the areas are itchy</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Use a humidifier in the bedroom during the cold, dry seasons to help prevent dry skin.</p>

        <h2>Treatments</h2>
        <p>The medical professional may prescribe a topical steroid ointment if the skin is inflamed or very itchy.</p>
        <p>If the medical professional suspects that a medical condition is causing your dry skin, they may do blood tests or other diagnostic procedures. The best treatment for dry skin caused by a medical problem is to treat the underlying medical problem.</p>
