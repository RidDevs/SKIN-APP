        <h1>Chickenpox (Varicella)</h1>
    </header>

    <div class="container">
        <h2>What is Chickenpox?</h2>
        <p>Chickenpox (also called varicella) is a highly contagious viral infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus. It is known for causing an itchy rash with red spots and fluid-filled blisters. The condition is common in children but can also affect adults, often with more severe symptoms. It was once a common childhood illness, but due to vaccination, it is less frequent today.</p>

        <h2>Signs and Symptoms</h2>
        <p>The symptoms of chickenpox generally appear 10-21 days after exposure to the virus. The early signs can include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fever</li>
            <li>Fatigue or feeling tired</li>
            <li>Loss of appetite</li>
            <li>Headache</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once these symptoms appear, the characteristic rash follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Red spots or bumps that turn into fluid-filled blisters</li>
            <li>The rash usually starts on the face, chest, and back, then spreads to the rest of the body</li>
            <li>The blisters eventually break and form scabs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The rash can be very itchy and may be more severe in adults and people with weakened immune systems.</p>

        <h2>How is Chickenpox Spread?</h2>
        <p>Chickenpox spreads easily from person to person through:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Direct contact with the blisters or rash, including scratching</li>
            <li>Airborne droplets from coughing or sneezing</li>
            <li>Close contact with an infected person before the rash appears</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's possible to catch chickenpox even if the infected person doesn't show visible symptoms yet. You are contagious from 1-2 days before the rash appears until all the blisters have scabbed over (about 5-7 days after the rash appears).</p>

        <h2>When to Seek Medical Attention</h2>
        <p>Although chickenpox typically resolves on its own, there are some situations where medical attention is necessary. Seek immediate medical care if:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The rash becomes infected (pus-filled blisters or increased redness)</li>
            <li>You have trouble breathing, or the rash spreads to the eyes or mouth</li>
            <li>The fever is very high (above 102°F or 39°C) or lasts for more than four days</li>
            <li>The person affected is pregnant, newborn, or has a weakened immune system</li>
            <li>Severe dehydration occurs, and the person cannot drink fluids</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Treatment Options</h2>
        <p>Chickenpox generally does not require prescription treatment for most people, as it tends to resolve on its own. However, there are several home treatments and remedies to alleviate the symptoms:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Soothing baths</span> – Oatmeal baths or calamine lotion can help reduce itching and soothe the skin.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Pain relievers</span> – Non-prescription drugs like acetaminophen (Tylenol) can help lower fever and ease discomfort. Do not use aspirin, as it may cause a serious condition known as Reye's syndrome.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Topical ointments</span> – Apply calamine lotion or hydrocortisone cream to reduce itching.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Hydration</span> – It's essential to stay hydrated during chickenpox. Drink plenty of fluids, especially if fever is present.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Antiviral Medications</h2>
        <p>In more severe cases or if you have a weakened immune system, antiviral medications such as acyclovir may be prescribed to reduce the severity of the illness and shorten recovery time. It is most effective if started within 24 hours of the appearance of the rash.</p>

        <h2>Prevention: Vaccination</h2>
        <p>The best way to prevent chickenpox is through vaccination. The varicella vaccine is highly effective in preventing the infection and its complications. The vaccine is recommended for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All children aged 12-15 months, with a second dose between 4-6 years</li>
            <li>People who have not had chickenpox or the vaccine (a one-dose vaccine is recommended for those 13 and older)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For adults who have not had chickenpox or the vaccine, it is especially important to get vaccinated, as chickenpox in adults can lead to complications such as pneumonia or brain infections.</p>

        <h2>Complications of Chickenpox</h2>
        <p>Though chickenpox is typically a mild illness in children, it can cause serious complications, especially in adults, pregnant women, and those with compromised immune systems. Possible complications include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Bacterial skin infections</span> – Scratching the blisters can lead to bacterial infections.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Pneumonia</span> – Chickenpox can cause inflammation in the lungs, leading to pneumonia.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Encephalitis</span> – A rare but serious brain infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Shingles</span> – The virus remains dormant in the body after chickenpox and can reactivate years later, causing shingles (a painful rash).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Self-Care and Tips for Recovery</h2>
        <p>In addition to the medical treatments, there are a few self-care practices to help you recover more comfortably:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Avoid scratching</span> – Scratching can lead to scars and infection. Trim nails and wear mittens if necessary to prevent scratching in young children.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Rest and sleep</span> – Resting helps your body recover and strengthens the immune system.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Wear loose, soft clothing</span> – Tight clothing can irritate the rash, so opt for loose, comfortable attire.</li>
        </ul>
